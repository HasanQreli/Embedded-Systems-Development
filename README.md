# PIC-Programming

Implementations for various tasks with PIC18F8722 based structure within the content of Ceng336-Introduction to Embedded Systems Development Course, written in both in assembly and C.

All tasks written are for PIC18F8722 based architecture with MPLAB X IDE.

# [THE1](THE1/)
A device that is capable of rendering two kinds of progress bars using LEDs according to the user input.

# [THE2](THE2/)
A simple Tetris-like game. Using the basic interrupt operations and seven-segment display using PIC18F8722 microprocessor and the provided boards.

# [THE3](THE3/)
Developed a program for the flight director component of an autopilot system, responsible for calculating the travelled distance based on speed and ending the simulation when the remaining distance is zero. The program also needs to handle messages from the autopilot and send status updates. Achieving this by using Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and Universal Synchronous Receiver Transmitter (USART) modules of our development kits.
